# musical-tension-model
An implemention of Farbood (2012) musical tension model.  Currently the input format is a MIDI file.

Some notes:

testTensionModel.py is a sample script showing how the model can be used.  

The features analyses are somewhat preliminary. In particular, the harmonic/tonal tension component needs to be updated.  
Currently utilized is R. Guo's midi-miner, which produces tonal tension values based on Chew's spiral array model.
